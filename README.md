# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
Tutorial/design/css used from [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) by Traversy Media. 
## Steps

### 1. Use Create React App to generate template react app

```
npx create-react-app react-phonebook
```

Create react app generates a generic react app which you can modify to create a personalized app. It generates/imports all the required files and resources needed to run the app, setting up a development environment.\

Run the template app by using 
```
npm start
```
and view on http://localhost:3000/

### 2. Create necesary components for the phonebook

A react app is comprised of several components that each represent a part of the application. In this phonebook application, seperate components represent the indvidual numbers, the add and search features, the buttons, and more. 

Technologies used in components include:
* Form submission
* State
* Styling
* Props

### 3. Run and test
Start the development server on localhost:3000 by running `npm start`.

Before adding a backend, hardcoded values can be added as a state in App.js which can be used to test the add, remove, and favorite features. The changes made will dissapear after refreshing the page.
